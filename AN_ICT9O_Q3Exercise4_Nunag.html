	<p>Juneau is one of the places I personally have been to. It is the captial of Alaska and we got there by riding a cruise. It is a very famous tourist spot because, as mentioned, it is the capital and it has a population of 32,549 people. It has an average temperature of 4°C until 15°C. We went there May of 2018. On previous studies, it was stated that over 1 Million people visit Juneau every year and that number is still constantly increasing by the second. For me, Juneau is one of a kind. It is my favorite city over the hundreds of cities I have been to. While en route to Juneau, our captain gave us some fun facts about the place. He said that it has been renamed twice in its existence. It was once called Harrisburg then it was changed to Juneau. </p>

	<p>We went whale watching and skiing. There were a lot of activities to do in Juneau because it is a big place. You could also go on dog sleighs down the mountain and you could play hockey there too. There were also a lot of Huskies there since Huskies like the cold and Juneau is perfect for them.</p>
